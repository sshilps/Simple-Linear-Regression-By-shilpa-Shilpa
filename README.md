# Data Preprocessing:
Started with cleaning and preparing the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability. Dealt with missing values, outliers, and performed necessary transformations to get the data ready for analysis.
Splitting into Training and Test 
**step of splitting the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split from sklearn.model_selection. This ensures the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.
# Visualizing Training and Test Plots:
matplotlib to create insightful visualizations. Plotted the training data to understand the model's learning process and then visualized the test data to evaluate its predictive performance.
# Utilized sklearn.linear_model:
Implemented Simple Linear Regression using the powerful LinearRegression module from sklearn.linear_model. This allowed for efficient modeling and prediction.
# Key Takeaways:
Insights from Training Data: Explored how the model learned from the training data and identified patterns.
Evaluation on Test Data: Assessed the model's predictive capabilities on unseen data to ensure its reliability in real-world scenarios.
